# wait-for-it-dns

Based off of [https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it), but instead attempts to do a host lookup with the built in dns settings of wherever the script is being run. Same usage, but instead of a host:port, make sure to provide a dns name instead.
